## Goal
Perform text mining.

## Instructions
Run results.py. The result are printed out on the IDE.

## Requirements
Package: NLTK, SpaCy, NumPy

## Note
The code performs data preprocessing, document-term matrix, tf-idf transformation, keywords generation, PCA, and K-means. I am still working on the remaining part.
